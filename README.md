# Hi, I'm Kirti Fatak ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm passionate about Instrumentation and Control, and I love working on projects that bridge the gap between education and industry. In my free time, I enjoy connecting with people and exploring new technologies.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### Project 1: line follower
- **Description:** Developed a line follower robot that uses sensors to detect and follow a predefined path. The robot adjusts its movements based on the path's line, demonstrating efficient real-time path-following capabilities.
- **Technologies Used:** Microcontrollers, sensors, motor drivers, and programming languages such as C/C++.]


### Project 2: Remote Control, Voice Control, and Obstacle Avoidance Car
- **Description:** Designed and built a multifunctional car capable of being controlled remotely, via voice commands, and autonomously avoiding obstacles. The car integrates various control systems to demonstrate flexibility and advanced navigation capabilities.
- **Technologies Used:** Microcontrollers, Bluetooth modules, voice recognition modules, ultrasonic sensors, motor drivers, and programming languages such as C/C++.

### Project: AI-Based Personal Health Assistant
- **Description:** Developed an AI-driven personal health assistant that provides personalized health advice, tracks wellness metrics, and offers recommendations based on user input. Leveraged OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities to create an interactive and intuitive user experience.
- **Technologies Used:** OpenAI APIs, machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, Python.

### Project: AI Course Information Generator
- **Description:** Created an AI-powered tool that generates detailed course information based on user queries. The tool utilizes OpenAI's language models to provide comprehensive and accurate descriptions, prerequisites, and learning outcomes for various courses.
- **Technologies Used:** OpenAI APIs, machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, Python.
